        <li>Applications Protection is essential for effective data security since, Applications have access to information stored,
        whether it be locally or on a remote source. It is the developers who provide security to applications.</li>
        <li>The HSIN YI Application Security Platform provides unique protection in the runtime as our products assimilate into the
        origin of application’s compilation.</li>
        <li>For some time, we have used systems for application protection on platforms on which applications run and the data
        applications use. Our intelligence gathers and analyses traffic of data from multiple sources - industry research, IP
        reputations, mitigation platforms, Security Operation Centers (SOC), among others to identify threats, and enable
        preventive security methods.</li>
        <li>HSIN YI delivers application integrity protection and provides protection to your computer by controlling the behaviour
        of applications. It protects applications and their associated data, preventing hacker attacks and malicious software
        from activating.</li>
        <li>Upon launch of a new application, HSIN YI lets you decide whether it should be launched without restrictions, or in an
        isolated area or completely altogether.</li>
        <li>In this way application protection prevents an unknown application – which malware always is – from activating on your
        PC.</li>
        <li>Sometimes one application may wish to make changes to another. Extend your application protection to the executable
        modules within your applications against unauthorized modifications by hackers and viruses.</li>
        <li>Data protection is the most vital strength of application. HSIN YI lets you read/write access to data files of an
        application.</li>
