        <li>Domain name service (DNS) is hugely important for Internet and users of the Internet and everything that establishes it
        connection to it.</li>
        <li>Whether it be from a business, an individual user, or a connected device, every web request, begins with a DNS query.</li>
        <li>The fact that DNS is considered important not only makes it vulnerable to attacks, it carries major implications for
        anyone responsible for Internet security, service infrastructure, or web performance and reliability.</li>
        <li>Any decision related to its design, implementation, and use must be weighed vis-vis criticality of DNS. Although DNS is
        capable of providing a standard platform but not all DNS services are created equal. HSINY helps you make DNS for
        business and customer transactions fast and secure.</li>
